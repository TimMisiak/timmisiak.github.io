# Tim Misiak

I've been working on debuggers and diagnostics for most of my professional career as a software engineer. For more than a decade, I've been working on the Microsoft Debugger Platform team, working on tools such as WinDbg and KD. I started the [WinDbgNext](https://aka.ms/windbgpreview) project in 2016 that modernized WinDbg UI. I also wrote a chunk of the X86/X64 emulator used by [Time Travel Debugging](https://aka.ms/ttd).
