Ever since I started tweeting about WinDbg and debugging, I&rsquo;ve been thinking that I have some longer things I want to write about that don&rsquo;t really fit on twitter. I&rsquo;ve done a few of these as videos on my <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyQ7p63-9V9PZJvgHLKgsaw>YouTube channel</a>, but those are very time consuming to make and most people don&rsquo;t seem to watch the whole video. So I think a lot of what I want to talk about is probably best suited for a blog format.</p><p>In any case, I plan to talk about a few different things. For one, I&rsquo;ll write about WinDbg and other Windows debugging tools. It&rsquo;s an area I&rsquo;ve worked on for more than a decade, and there are lots of things I&rsquo;ve learned that I think you might find helpful for low level debugging, reverse engineering, and other development work on Windows. The second area that I plan to write about is the art and science of debugging itself. While building debugging tools, I&rsquo;ve had the chance to spend a lot of time thinking about what it means to be effective at debugging problems. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about knowing the right tool to use, but oftentimes it&rsquo;s just as important to understand the process of debugging.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
